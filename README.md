Good evening Dr. Mario, 



Congratulations on accepting an offer on your home! My name is Jennifer and I am the Acquisition Coordinator for this transaction. I will be your main point of contact moving forward to ensure a smooth experience during the purchase process.


There will be a general inspection, termite inspection, and 3D scan to provide a virtual tour of the home. In total, the appointments should take 2.5-3 hours but we can also spread them out if you prefer not to have so many people in the home.

 

Once the inspections are completed I will check in with you to go over the results and see if any secondary inspections are needed on the major systems. If no secondary inspections are needed we will have the repair amount, if any, ready for you the following week or sooner.



The next step is scheduling the inspections. The inspection company is available at the times below. Do any of these times work for you?

Tues. 04/20 @ 2pm
Wed 04/21 @ 9am or 2pm


Thank you, 

Jennifer Amador | REDFINNOW | Acquisitions Coordinator
